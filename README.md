# Fit-Pro-Quo

Fit-Pro-Quo is a small site made for the code institute Data Centric Milestone Project. Here You can create, edit and delete pre-planned training session. The aim is to help people plan training, specific to what sport they want to progress in. Sports can be added in and deleted out if needed.

## UX

When the user first opens the home page, they are clearly presented with different options to take them to different pages elsewhere in the site. The navbar and footer is clearly laid out, easy to read and consistent throughout the whole site.

The Fit Tracker page is where all planned and completed sessions are displayed for the user to see. Each session is shown in date order for ease of use and once clicked on is expanded to show more detail. The specific details of each session are laid out in a table format which is easy for the user to process and understand. Once completed the user can use the Feedback button to add extra information or if the training session had changed in anyway then they can edit what was already there. There is also the option to delete each session if the user decides that it is no longer needed in the fit Tracker.

On the Sports page, all the different sport categories are displayed in a similar format to the Fit Tracker page however simply just more compact. The extra detail under every sport helps the user to understand how many activities they have under each different sport category. Again, the user has the ability to add and delete different sport categories when needed.

The final page on the navbar is the add session. This is so the user has quick access to this form at all points while on the site. Here they fill out the simple form that will update the Fit Tracker page with any new sessions the user has added.

## Features

Fit-Pro-Quo is an interactive site that allows users the plan, create, review, edit and delete specific sessions.

The user can add both sessions with session plans specific to their sport and there expected fatigue levels along with the ability to add a new sport to the database. When a user has added either a new session or sport the database is updated and the new information is then displayed in other places on the site. 

All sessions added to the database are also able to be edited and updated with feedback from the user. The site will load all the current data from the database and then display it in an easy to understand format for the user to modify and submit. 

Both the sessions and the sports can also be deleted from the database. Both are linked with a modal so that the user will never accidentally delete a session without meaning to. Once the information has been deleted it cannot be retrieved however can be recreated by the user if needed.

Finally, on the sports page the information below each sport counts the number of times that sport is used throughout the action_tracker database which in turn tells the user how many sessions they have planned/completed under each sport.

### Future features

In the future I would potentially change the layout of the Fit Tracker page to a calendar layout so that finding session could be even easier.

I would also like to add in more input options for the Fit Tracker sessions so that the user can be even more specific in what they want to achieve and do in each individual session.

I would also like to have a completed feature added so that you can filter down the sessions on the Fit Tracker page to those that have been completed and those that are yet to be completed.

## Technologies Used 

Google Chrome developer tools (https://www.google.com/chrome/)- I used these to test my site on different device sizes and to receive information from javascript in the console.\

Google fronts (https://fonts.google.com/)- Google fonts allowed me to change my text throughout the site to give it a more appropriate style and look for the user.\

Materialize (https://materializecss.com/)- Materialize was used throughout this site for its grid system and different layout features. It has allowed me to change sizes and add features to my site which has helped give it a more professional look and easier for the user to understand.\

JQuery (https://jquery.com/)- JQuery has made it easier to target specific aspects of the site in javascript by simplifying the DOM.\

W3C validator (https://validator.w3.org/)- The W3C validator allowed to check my code is clean and had no faults.\
